### Meetup Summary

I attend a meetup on Feb 5th, 2018. It is not a data science meetup because I cannot find any similar meetup within 50 miles. So I attend a toastmasters meetup. This meetup helps people practice public lecture and improve their leadership. 

I attend this meetup as a guest. After openings we go through table talks answering the questions brought up by table talk masters. Then several presenters present their formal talk and evaluaters give their evaluation. The speech time is kept by the timer and he puts on a red light indicating if the speech passes the pre-set time. Finally, the host summarize the meetup by talking about the potential improvement of each talks.

I feel this is a very nice environment and it helps me speaking in front of public. The take-away for me is that, before I give a talk, I need to take a moment and carefully think about the answer I am about to give.
