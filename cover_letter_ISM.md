Dear Kelsey,

It is a great pleasure for me to apply for the predictive analytics analyst position in ISM Canada. The following skills and qualifications make me an asset to the advanced analysis team.

The biggest assets I can bring is my skills in machine learning. During my masters, I spend 3 years building predictive models for medical imaging and biometrics. This gives me a solid understanding of some advanced topics in machine learning such as big data and deep learning.

Besides, I have a general understanding of other parts of data science. I am confident in performing data cleaning, inferential statistics, exploratory data analysis, and machine learning using Python. I have built up a GitHub page to show my skills and here is a summary link: https://github.com/ZackCode/datasci_workshop/blob/master/README.md. 

Last but not least, I want to state my passion towards ISM Canada. Saskatchewan is a nice place. Within this province, ISM Canada is among the very few companies having a whole team on data science. I know the team and the managers are very supportive from my last interview, and I dream of working in such environment. 

In conclusion, I am deeply motivated by the predictive analyst position in ISM Canada. I would definitely love to talk with you and discuss the value that I can bring to the team. I appreciate your consideration and look forward to hearing from you.

Best Regards,

Zexi
